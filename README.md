# Discord Repost Detector
A simple bot that checks if the current message has already been posted in a text channel. Only checks Twitter links for now.  

Create an .env file in the same directory as repostdetector.py and add:  
DISCORD_TOKEN = "your Discord bot token" (no quotes)  
CHANNEL1 = "channel 1 ID", CHANNEL2 = "channel 2 ID", ... etc (no quotes) for each text channel to monitor
